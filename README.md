> This package follows the `PSR-0` convention names for its classes, which means you can easily integrate these classes loading in your own autoloader.

#### Versions

Works with [ 5.4 / 5.5 ]

## Usage

There are two ways of loading the config.

 * You can either load it as a hash object with the same structure into a variable.
 * Or you can load it directly into `$_ENV` with the key formed by concatenizing the path keys with underscores.

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// When the config is
// => array('port' => 6000, 'db' => array('pass' => 'sun'))

// Using URL
Confy\Config::env("https://user:pass@api.confy.io/orgs/company/project/app/envs/production");

// or using options hash
Confy\Config::env(array(
  'host' => 'https://api.confy.io', 'user' => 'user', 'pass' => 'pass',
  'org' => 'company', 'project' => 'app', 'env' => 'production'
));

// ['port']
$_ENV['PORT'] // => 6000

// ['db']['pass']
$_ENV['DB_PASS'] // => 'sun'
```

```php
// Retrieve the config using URL
$config = Confy\Config::load("https://user:pass@api.confy.io/orgs/company/project/app/envs/production");

// or using options hash
$config = Confy\Config::load(array(
  'host' => 'https://api.confy.io', 'user' => 'user', 'pass' => 'pass',
  'org' => 'company', 'project' => 'app', 'env' => 'production'
));

$config['port'] // => 6000
$config['db']['pass'] // => 'sun'

// Or you could instantiate a client to work with other api (as shown below)
```
